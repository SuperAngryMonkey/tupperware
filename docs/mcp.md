# Tupperware MCP

The `mcp/` directory ships a Model Context Protocol server that lets an AI client
(Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible client) drive provisioning —
listing containers and cloning the golden template — without the web UI or a shell.

## What it is

A stdio MCP server (`mcp/tupperware_mcp.py`, built on FastMCP) that is a **thin
HTTP client** over the Tupperware web app. It runs no `pct` or SSH itself; every
action goes through the same HTTP endpoints the browser UI uses. That is the whole
security posture: the server has no more reach than a web-UI user on the tailnet,
and far less code in which to get it wrong.

```

                                                            pct clone → tailnet join
```

## Tools

| Tool | Kind | Backing endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tupperware_host_status` | read | `GET /api/status` | counts, tailnet peers, next free VMID, storage backends, template readiness |
| `tupperware_list_containers` | read | `GET /api/containers` | LXC inventory (template excluded) |
| `tupperware_provision` | write | `POST /clone-stream` | clone + join tailnet; **dry-run by default** |

No destroy or transfer tool is exposed — provisioning and reads only, by design.

### `tupperware_provision` safety

`dry_run` defaults to `True`. A dry run resolves the plan (target VMID, storage,
sizing) from `/api/status` and returns it **without creating anything**. To
actually clone, the client calls again with `dry_run=False`. In Claude Desktop
each call is separately user-approved, so a real provision is two deliberate
approvals — plan, then execute.

## Endpoints added to the web app (v0.2.1)

The MCP needs machine-readable reads, so `webui/app.py` gained:

- `GET /api/status` — `host_metrics()` plus `storages`, `default_storage`, `template_ready`
- `GET /api/containers` — `{"containers": [...]}`

Both are read-only JSON wrappers around functions the dashboard already used.

Since v0.2.2 they are covered by the web app's HTTP Basic Auth when the host has an
auth file, and since v0.2.6 by `TUPPERWARE_ALLOW_SOURCES` when that is set — so the
MCP must authenticate like any other client (see Configuration below). On a host with
neither configured they remain open, consistent with the tailnet-only access model.

## Configuration

| Env | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TUPPERWARE_URL` | _(required)_ | Base URL of the web app, e.g. `http://192.0.2.9:8080` (placeholder address). Use the tailnet IP / MagicDNS name if the client isn't on the app's LAN. |
| `TUPPERWARE_USER` | _(unset)_ | Basic Auth username, when the target host has an auth file. |
| `TUPPERWARE_PASS` | _(unset)_ | Basic Auth password. Both must be set; leave both unset against an un-authed host. |
| `TUPPERWARE_TIMEOUT` | `600` | Provision timeout (s). A clone plus network wait can take minutes. |
| `TUPPERWARE_READ_TIMEOUT` | `45` | Read-call timeout (s). Raise for slow hosts with many containers. |

A `401` from any tool means the host has auth on and the client env is missing or wrong;
a `403` means the client's source address is outside that host's `TUPPERWARE_ALLOW_SOURCES`.
The full server-side reference is in the [README Configuration section](../README.md#configuration).

## Setup

See [`mcp/README.md`](../mcp/README.md) for venv install and client registration
(Claude Code `claude mcp add`, or the `claude_desktop_config.json` block for
Claude Desktop).

## Verifying independently of a client

`mcp/check_mcp.py` performs a real MCP handshake against the server and prints the
tool list. If it prints the three tools, the server is good and any failure is
client-side registration:

```bash
cd mcp && ./.venv/bin/python check_mcp.py
```
